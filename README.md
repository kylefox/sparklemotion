experiments in code and motion. http://sparklemotion.me/

Currently pulling old experiments into this project. Eventually I'd like to have this project be super cleverly laid so it's dead simple to write/publish a new experiment. But for now I'm just dumping straight HTML and ugly JavaScript.

Note that some of these experiments are based on stuff I've found around the interweb. For example, I didn't invent [harmonic motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion) myself.
